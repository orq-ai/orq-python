Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly \"stuck\" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason=\"length\", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length."
