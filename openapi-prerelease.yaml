This endpoint manages the full lifecycle of an agent interaction, from receiving the initial message through all processing steps until completion. Supports synchronous execution (waits for completion) and asynchronous execution (returns immediately with task ID). The response includes all messages exchanged, tool calls made, and token usage statistics. Ideal for request-response patterns where you need the complete interaction result."

Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly \"stuck\" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason=\"length\", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length."
